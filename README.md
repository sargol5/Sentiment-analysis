# Sentiment-analysis
I used sentiment analysis in this research to assess whether the product is recommended or not. To generate more accurate predictions, I did the project in three phases:1- predicting using title only 2- predicting by using review text only 3- predicting by using title and review text only 4- Predicting using Title and Review Text where Positive Feedback Count is greater than 1, and I used four Machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). I got the dataset from the Kaggle website's Woman Clothing Review. The accuracy of Naive Bayes and SVM appear better than the scores of other models in each phase. With Predicting using Title and Review Text where Positive Feedback Count is greater than 1, I got better accuracy 79 % and 80 % for SVM and Naive Bayes algorithms. There is no clear answer to the question of which algorithms are superior; each performs better in different data sets and under different conditions. Each modelling algorithm has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.
